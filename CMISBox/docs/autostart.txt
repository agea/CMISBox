You can add the application to the user's "Login Items" (under System Preferences=>Accounts=[user]) or you can add a launchd agent to the user's ~/Library/LaunchAgents folder (see man launchd.plist). Use ~/Library/LaunchDaemons/ if your app has no user-facing UI. As others point out, launchd gives you a lot of control over when the app starts, what happens if the app quits or crashes, etc. and is most appropriate for "daemon" style apps (with our without UI).
